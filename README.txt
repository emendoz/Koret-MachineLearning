#            Machine Learning for CS Education:                #
#  Predicting Student Grades from Early Performance (Group 2)  #
#--------------------------------------------------------------#

Status: Complete, but can be improved upon
Description:
Competed in the CS Education Data Mining Challenge. Researched and tested on the public dataset of student code submissions (Spring and Fall 2019) known as CodeWorkout provided by the organization hosting the challenge. Code files provided indicate work towards Track 1 of the challenge. Track 1, titled Knowledge Tracing, is predicting a students' performance on a problem before they start it based on prior problems.

This Google Drive contains 6 files including this README.txt file.
* Task1ProgSnap.ipynb
** (Google Colab file) Implementation of Progsnap code along with initial testings to get a sense of the data as well as understand basic performance testings.

* ErrorQuotientforFALL2019.ipynb
** (Google Colab file) Expanding upon initial testings and implementing error events to calculate a better performance prediction on struggling students.

* KORETResearchPoster.pptx
** (Powerpoint file) Digital copy of research poster for the Sonoma State University 2022 Week of Research & Creativity (School of Science and Technology Symposium).

* Colloquium Slides
** (Google Slides file) May 11, 2022 presentation.

* CSEDM Data Challenge.py
** (Python file) A python file generated from the final version of the Google Collab notebook we worked on. Contains the fully implemented EQ score, time between events feature and data clustering from KMeans. Tests multiple models after generating results of the logistic regression, which performed the best in the end.
